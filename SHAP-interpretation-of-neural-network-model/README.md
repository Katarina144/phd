# SHAP Analysis for Hydrogen Prediction from Waste Gasification

This notebook applies SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the predictions made by a trained neural network model estimating annual hydrogen yields from waste gasification.

The model was trained on a Monte Carlo dataset simulating realistic process configurations for the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA). SHAP is used here to understand which input features have the greatest influence on model predictions ‚Äî both globally and for each feedstock type individually.

##  üìÇ Dataset

This repo assumes access to the Monte Carlo simulation results used to train the model. You can download the input dataset here:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Runtime

Due to restricted GPU access on the university's HPC, this analysis runs using the slower CPU-based `KernelExplainer`. That means:

- **Global SHAP analysis** takes a few minutes  
- **Per-feedstock SHAP analysis** takes significantly longer (especially for full-feature plots across all 5 feedstocks)

If you're running the full analysis, it's best to let it run in the background or overnight.

## About the Model

The model being explained was trained to predict `ANNUALENERGY_H2_kwh` from a wide range of process, feedstock, and system-level features (53 in total). Input data was scaled using MinMaxScaler, and missing values were median-imputed. SHAP was computed using 500 representative samples across the dataset to balance runtime and fidelity.

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Outputs

- 6 global summary plots (top 10, top 20, full ‚Äî in dot and bar styles)
- 30 per-feedstock summary plots (top 5, top 10, full √ó 5 feedstocks)
- Plots saved in high-resolution PNG for publication or presentation use.

Feel free to adapt or reuse the SHAP workflow for your own models ‚Äî the variable mapping and plotting functions are designed to be flexible.
